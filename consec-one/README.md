Create a function that will accept an array of binary integers as it's input. Your function should return the maximum number of consecutive number 1's in the array.

// given:
let nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1];
findConsecutive(nums);

// return:
3

// max consecutive 1's in the array -> [1, 1, 1]

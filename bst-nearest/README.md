Create a function that accepts a BST and a "nearest" as it's inputs. Your function should traverse the BST and return the node with a value that is "nearest" to what was passed in. For example, if your tree contains 2 nodes with respective values of "10" and "2", if your function contains a "3" as it's "nearest" input, the node with the value of "2" should be returned. If you pass it "8", then the node with a value of "10" should be returned.

Create a function that will accept an array as it's input. Your function should find all numbers dissappeared from that array, with a starting integer of 1 and an ending integer of the highest value in the array.

For example, given an array of integers [1, 2, 4, 5], your function should return 3.

Here's another example - given an array of [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3], your function should return [1, 5, 6].

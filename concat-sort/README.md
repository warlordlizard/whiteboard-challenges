Create a function that accepts 2 presorted arrays of integers as it's input. Your function should merge these 2 arrays and return a final single sorted array.

Note: The length of either array does not matter. All integers in the array will be whole numbers with a positive value.

For example:

// given:
[2, 5, 13, 21]

// and:
[3, 19, 27, 31]

// return:
[2, 3, 5, 13, 19, 21, 27, 31]

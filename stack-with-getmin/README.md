Create a stack.js module that contains a stack constructor and the following methods:

push - pushes an element onto the stack
pop - removes an element from the stack
peek - gets the top element of the stack
getMin - gets the minimum element in the stack - this should work for positive and negative values
Note: Your stack implementation may be created using the class syntax, if you choose.

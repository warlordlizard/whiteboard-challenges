Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties:

the highest value in the array
the second highest value in the array
Write at least four tests for this function

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
